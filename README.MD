Testproject about multithreading and parallelism in computer vision.

still in progress, alpha, as of 5th October 2020

Currently this is CPU only as (at the moment) this is more an exercise about multithreading itself than computer vision. Computer vision is mainly used to provide use-cases and examples.

At the moment the highlight of this project is an implementation of a multithreaded for-loop that allows to parallelize up to each individual iteration.
